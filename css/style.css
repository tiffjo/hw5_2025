/* Step 6 
Identify the proper selector to style ONLY those header elements that are direct children of a card class.  The required styling is the following: 
background: #288088,
solid 2px border using #45ADAD,
20px of padding on the top and the bottom, 
50px border-radius on the top left and right corners.

/* Step 7  Edit the css for the card class to match our example. Achieve this by using a flex-property to specify an initial “size” of 450px.  You need to think about this from a “flex” perspective and realize that flex-direction will affect the size of the elements.  You can see that in the mobile view they all have the same width.
